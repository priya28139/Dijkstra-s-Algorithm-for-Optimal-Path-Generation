# Dijkstra-s-Algorithm-for-Optimal-Path-Generation
This repository is aimed at demonstrating the use of Dijkstra's algorithm to generate an optimal path taking the following interesting use case. Sam is stuck in the jungles of California comprising of a certain number of villages. Luckily enough, he has a map of the villages and the distances between each of them. Additionally, he possesses a bottle of water that will run out when he walks a specific number of kilometres (he consumes 1 liter of water per kilometre he walks). The bottle can be refilled at any of the villages, but nowhere else. 


The folder contains the following files:
1. A C++ source code file
2. A C++ executable file
3. A C++ object file
4. A text file containing map information for 100 villages
5. A text file containing map information for 300 villages
